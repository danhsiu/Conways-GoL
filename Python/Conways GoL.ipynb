    "The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n",

    "1. **Underpopulation/Exposure**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.\n",

    "The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed — births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick/generation.

    "A naive approach to a simulating the GoL would be to go through every cell, check for any alive neighbours, and determine the state of the cell in the next generation. While this would work, it would be inefficient for larger grid sizes where only a fraction of livecells may be found. If we had an infinitely sized board, an iterative solution by scanning all cells wouldn't work. There are a few solutions around this which have implications to how the cells interact generation-to-generation, and for animation purposes. A few solutions are present:\n",

Since we are exploring an algorithmic solution, Python works as a perfect testbed without the worries of integer overflows. However, it would be important to point out some inherent benefits (i.e., to cell generation speed and memory management) in utilizing an alternative language like C/C++.

Using explicit SIMD instructions to increase our register size to 256 bits (AVX2), or 512 bits (AVX-512) may potentially lead to doubling in performance. \n",
